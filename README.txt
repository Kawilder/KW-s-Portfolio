Hello. 
this is a online portfolio for Kevin Wilder. inside the folders there is a resume placeholder, a HTML file
and assets folder with a css folder and images folder inside of it. the current "works" that are displayed
on the page are just stock images that are clickable linmks to the original source. and I did not hook up 
any functional phone number or email but they are still clickable links. The github one is real and links 
to my github account. 
Thanks for reading
